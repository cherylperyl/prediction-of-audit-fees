### üìú 1. <u>[Final R Project Script.R](https://github.com/cherylperyl/prediction-of-audit-fees/blob/main/Final%20R%20Project%20Script.R)</u>
In this file, the given data was analysed and meticulously cleaned. Following that, Regression Analysis was performed to see which factors would help to give a more accurate prediction of Audit Fees. Techniques used:
1. Feature Engineering
2. Feature Transformation
3. Forward/ Backward Selection (for Regression)
4. Stepwise Regression (for Regression)
5. Classification Tree

### üìÇ 2. <u>[Text Analysis folder](https://github.com/cherylperyl/prediction-of-audit-fees/tree/main/text%20analysis)</u>
In this file, Na√Øve Bayes algorithm was used to analyse the 'Company Description' coloumn. Steps:
1. Create dummy column for each word occurence (Data was too large for R to handle so this step is performed by the python script)
2. Na√Øve Bayes algorithmis then applied to the word counts data to find out which words generally appear in companies with Audit Fees below/above the 50th percentile.
